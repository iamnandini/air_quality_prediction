# Air Quality Index Prediction
A Concatenated Machine Learning model for the prediction of Air Quality Index of Delhi. 
In this project I used four models linear regression, random forest, decision tree regressor and support vector regressor with grid search. For the final concatenation of the project I used stacking regressor and linear regressor as the final estimator.
